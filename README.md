# VertexFusion
This is an open C++ library for processing arbitrary CAD data. 

Many free CAD programmes have a problem with using data formats that are used in a professional
environment. This library therefore makes it its mission to implement these formats freely. We 
can write some formats, but the focus is clearly on reading in the data, as this is usually easier
to implement. We do not limit ourselves to pure graphic formats. Other data formats are also used.

Currently we are in the process of translating a source code originally commented in German into 
English and uploading it here. As soon as the repository is independently compilable, we will release
the initial release here.

One of our interests in this project is the restriction to the C++ language. Unfortunately, there 
are a number of similar projects, which are a mixture of dependencies and languages, which makes it
difficult to integrate them into other projects. We shall reduce external dependencies to a minimum 
and use all implement all CAD-relevant content ourselves and here.

If bindings into other languages are desired, we will we will create our own repositories and collect
them here. 

In general we are looking forward to fellow contributors who will help us with this.
